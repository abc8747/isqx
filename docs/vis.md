Here is an interactive visualisation of (most) quantity kinds. The standalone
page can be found at [`/vis.html`](https://abc8747.github.io/isqx/vis.html?autoLoad).

Shift click to select multiple nodes.

## Implementation

Our [mkdocs/griffe plugin][isqx.mkdocs] uses of static and dynamic analysis to
collect all quantity kinds, constants and units into a single `objects.json`.

The visualiser is written in [solidjs](https://github.com/solidjs/solid) and D3.

When data is loaded, the size of the node is first determined by the number of
incoming links ("referenced by" in equations). A hierarchy is first formed and
the a force simulation is performed.

The colour of the nodes is determined by the order they are defined in code.

## TODO

- built-in search
- implement clickable links for units
- show numerical value for constants
- cross-ref to this items in this documentation
- fix label overlapping
